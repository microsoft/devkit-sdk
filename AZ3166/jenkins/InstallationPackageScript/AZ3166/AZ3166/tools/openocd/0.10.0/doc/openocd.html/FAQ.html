<h2 class="chapter">23 FAQ</h2>
<a name="index-faq"></a>
<ol>
<li><a name="faqrtck"></a></li><li> <b>RTCK, also known as: Adaptive Clocking - What is it?</b>
<a name="index-RTCK-2"></a>
<a name="index-adaptive-clocking-1"></a>
<br>

<p>In digital circuit design it is often refered to as &ldquo;clock
synchronisation&rdquo; the JTAG interface uses one clock (TCK or TCLK)
operating at some speed, your CPU target is operating at another.
The two clocks are not synchronised, they are &ldquo;asynchronous&rdquo;
</p>
<p>In order for the two to work together they must be synchronised
well enough to work; JTAG can&rsquo;t go ten times faster than the CPU,
for example. There are 2 basic options:
</p><ol>
<li> Use a special &quot;adaptive clocking&quot; circuit to change the JTAG
clock rate to match what the CPU currently supports.
</li><li> The JTAG clock must be fixed at some speed that&rsquo;s enough slower than
the CPU clock that all TMS and TDI transitions can be detected.
</li></ol>

<p><b>Does this really matter?</b> For some chips and some situations, this
is a non-issue, like a 500MHz ARM926 with a 5 MHz JTAG link;
the CPU has no difficulty keeping up with JTAG.
Startup sequences are often problematic though, as are other
situations where the CPU clock rate changes (perhaps to save
power).
</p>
<p>For example, Atmel AT91SAM chips start operation from reset with
a 32kHz system clock. Boot firmware may activate the main oscillator
and PLL before switching to a faster clock (perhaps that 500 MHz
ARM926 scenario).
If you&rsquo;re using JTAG to debug that startup sequence, you must slow
the JTAG clock to sometimes 1 to 4kHz. After startup completes,
JTAG can use a faster clock.
</p>
<p>Consider also debugging a 500MHz ARM926 hand held battery powered
device that enters a low power &ldquo;deep sleep&rdquo; mode, at 32kHz CPU
clock, between keystrokes unless it has work to do. When would
that 5 MHz JTAG clock be usable?
</p>
<p><b>Solution #1 - A special circuit</b>
</p>
<p>In order to make use of this,
your CPU, board, and JTAG adapter must all support the RTCK
feature. Not all of them support this; keep reading!
</p>
<p>The RTCK (&quot;Return TCK&quot;) signal in some ARM chips is used to help with
this problem. ARM has a good description of the problem described at
this link: <a href="http://www.arm.com/support/faqdev/4170.html">http://www.arm.com/support/faqdev/4170.html</a> [checked
28/nov/2008]. Link title: &ldquo;How does the JTAG synchronisation logic
work? / how does adaptive clocking work?&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The nice thing about adaptive clocking is that &ldquo;battery powered hand
held device example&rdquo; - the adaptiveness works perfectly all the
time. One can set a break point or halt the system in the deep power
down code, slow step out until the system speeds up.
</p>
<p>Note that adaptive clocking may also need to work at the board level,
when a board-level scan chain has multiple chips.
Parallel clock voting schemes are good way to implement this,
both within and between chips, and can easily be implemented
with a CPLD.
It&rsquo;s not difficult to have logic fan a module&rsquo;s input TCK signal out
to each TAP in the scan chain, and then wait until each TAP&rsquo;s RTCK comes
back with the right polarity before changing the output RTCK signal.
Texas Instruments makes some clock voting logic available
for free (with no support) in VHDL form; see
<a href="http://tiexpressdsp.com/index.php/Adaptive_Clocking">http://tiexpressdsp.com/index.php/Adaptive_Clocking</a>
</p>
<p><b>Solution #2 - Always works - but may be slower</b>
</p>
<p>Often this is a perfectly acceptable solution.
</p>
<p>In most simple terms: Often the JTAG clock must be 1/10 to 1/12 of
the target clock speed. But what that &ldquo;magic division&rdquo; is varies
depending on the chips on your board.
<b>ARM rule of thumb</b> Most ARM based systems require an 6:1 division;
ARM11 cores use an 8:1 division.
<b>Xilinx rule of thumb</b> is 1/12 the clock speed.
</p>
<p>Note: most full speed FT2232 based JTAG adapters are limited to a
maximum of 6MHz. The ones using USB high speed chips (FT2232H)
often support faster clock rates (and adaptive clocking).
</p>
<p>You can still debug the &rsquo;low power&rsquo; situations - you just need to
either use a fixed and very slow JTAG clock rate ... or else
manually adjust the clock speed at every step. (Adjusting is painful
and tedious, and is not always practical.)
</p>
<p>It is however easy to &ldquo;code your way around it&rdquo; - i.e.: Cheat a little,
have a special debug mode in your application that does a &ldquo;high power
sleep&rdquo;. If you are careful - 98% of your problems can be debugged
this way.
</p>
<p>Note that on ARM you may need to avoid using the <em>wait for interrupt</em>
operation in your idle loops even if you don&rsquo;t otherwise change the CPU
clock rate.
That operation gates the CPU clock, and thus the JTAG clock; which
prevents JTAG access. One consequence is not being able to <code>halt</code>
cores which are executing that <em>wait for interrupt</em> operation.
</p>
<p>To set the JTAG frequency use the command:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"># Example: 1.234MHz
adapter_khz 1234
</pre></div>


</li><li> <b>Win32 Pathnames</b> Why don&rsquo;t backslashes work in Windows paths?

<p>OpenOCD uses Tcl and a backslash is an escape char. Use { and }
around Windows filenames.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&gt; echo \a

&gt; echo {\a}
\a
&gt; echo &quot;\a&quot;

&gt;
</pre></div>


</li><li> <b>Missing: cygwin1.dll</b> OpenOCD complains about a missing cygwin1.dll.

<p>Make sure you have Cygwin installed, or at least a version of OpenOCD that
claims to come with all the necessary DLLs. When using Cygwin, try launching
OpenOCD from the Cygwin shell.
</p>
</li><li> <b>Breakpoint Issue</b> I&rsquo;m trying to set a breakpoint using GDB (or a frontend like Insight or
Eclipse), but OpenOCD complains that &quot;Info: arm7_9_common.c:213
arm7_9_add_breakpoint(): sw breakpoint requested, but software breakpoints not enabled&quot;.

<p>GDB issues software breakpoints when a normal breakpoint is requested, or to implement
source-line single-stepping. On ARMv4T systems, like ARM7TDMI, ARM720T or ARM920T,
software breakpoints consume one of the two available hardware breakpoints.
</p>
</li><li> <b>LPC2000 Flash</b> When erasing or writing LPC2000 on-chip flash, the operation fails at random.

<p>Make sure the core frequency specified in the <samp>flash lpc2000</samp> line matches the
clock at the time you&rsquo;re programming the flash. If you&rsquo;ve specified the crystal&rsquo;s
frequency, make sure the PLL is disabled. If you&rsquo;ve specified the full core speed
(e.g. 60MHz), make sure the PLL is enabled.
</p>
</li><li> <b>Amontec Chameleon</b> When debugging using an Amontec Chameleon in its JTAG Accelerator configuration,
I keep getting &quot;Error: amt_jtagaccel.c:184 amt_wait_scan_busy(): amt_jtagaccel timed
out while waiting for end of scan, rtck was disabled&quot;.

<p>Make sure your PC&rsquo;s parallel port operates in EPP mode. You might have to try several
settings in your PC BIOS (ECP, EPP, and different versions of those).
</p>
</li><li> <b>Data Aborts</b> When debugging with OpenOCD and GDB (plain GDB, Insight, or Eclipse),
I get lots of &quot;Error: arm7_9_common.c:1771 arm7_9_read_memory():
memory read caused data abort&quot;.

<p>The errors are non-fatal, and are the result of GDB trying to trace stack frames
beyond the last valid frame. It might be possible to prevent this by setting up
a proper &quot;initial&quot; stack frame, if you happen to know what exactly has to
be done, feel free to add this here.
</p>
<p><b>Simple:</b> In your startup code - push 8 registers of zeros onto the
stack before calling main(). What GDB is doing is &ldquo;climbing&rdquo; the run
time stack by reading various values on the stack using the standard
call frame for the target. GDB keeps going - until one of 2 things
happen <b>#1</b> an invalid frame is found, or <b>#2</b> some huge number of
stackframes have been processed. By pushing zeros on the stack, GDB
gracefully stops.
</p>
<p><b>Debugging Interrupt Service Routines</b> - In your ISR before you call
your C code, do the same - artifically push some zeros onto the stack,
remember to pop them off when the ISR is done.
</p>
<p><b>Also note:</b> If you have a multi-threaded operating system, they
often do not <b>in the intrest of saving memory</b> waste these few
bytes. Painful...
</p>

</li><li> <b>JTAG Reset Config</b> I get the following message in the OpenOCD console (or log file):
&quot;Warning: arm7_9_common.c:679 arm7_9_assert_reset(): srst resets test logic, too&quot;.

<p>This warning doesn&rsquo;t indicate any serious problem, as long as you don&rsquo;t want to
debug your core right out of reset. Your .cfg file specified <samp>jtag_reset
trst_and_srst srst_pulls_trst</samp> to tell OpenOCD that either your board,
your debugger or your target uC (e.g. LPC2000) can&rsquo;t assert the two reset signals
independently. With this setup, it&rsquo;s not possible to halt the core right out of
reset, everything else should work fine.
</p>
</li><li> <b>USB Power</b> When using OpenOCD in conjunction with Amontec JTAGkey and the Yagarto
toolchain (Eclipse, arm-elf-gcc, arm-elf-gdb), the debugging seems to be
unstable. When single-stepping over large blocks of code, GDB and OpenOCD
quit with an error message. Is there a stability issue with OpenOCD?

<p>No, this is not a stability issue concerning OpenOCD. Most users have solved
this issue by simply using a self-powered USB hub, which they connect their
Amontec JTAGkey to. Apparently, some computers do not provide a USB power
supply stable enough for the Amontec JTAGkey to be operated.
</p>
<p><b>Laptops running on battery have this problem too...</b>
</p>
</li><li> <b>GDB Disconnects</b> When using the Amontec JTAGkey, sometimes OpenOCD crashes with the following
error message: &quot;Error: gdb_server.c:101 gdb_get_char(): read: 10054&quot;.
What does that mean and what might be the reason for this?

<p>Error code 10054 corresponds to WSAECONNRESET, which means that the debugger (GDB)
has closed the connection to OpenOCD. This might be a GDB issue.
</p>
</li><li> <b>LPC2000 Flash</b> In the configuration file in the section where flash device configurations
are described, there is a parameter for specifying the clock frequency
for LPC2000 internal flash devices (e.g. <samp>flash bank $_FLASHNAME lpc2000
0x0 0x40000 0 0 $_TARGETNAME lpc2000_v1 14746 calc_checksum</samp>), which must be
specified in kilohertz. However, I do have a quartz crystal of a
frequency that contains fractions of kilohertz (e.g. 14,745,600 Hz,
i.e. 14,745.600 kHz). Is it possible to specify real numbers for the
clock frequency?

<p>No. The clock frequency specified here must be given as an integral number.
However, this clock frequency is used by the In-Application-Programming (IAP)
routines of the LPC2000 family only, which seems to be very tolerant concerning
the given clock frequency, so a slight difference between the specified clock
frequency and the actual clock frequency will not cause any trouble.
</p>
</li><li> <b>Command Order</b> Do I have to keep a specific order for the commands in the configuration file?

<p>Well, yes and no. Commands can be given in arbitrary order, yet the
devices listed for the JTAG scan chain must be given in the right
order (jtag newdevice), with the device closest to the TDO-Pin being
listed first. In general, whenever objects of the same type exist
which require an index number, then these objects must be given in the
right order (jtag newtap, targets and flash banks - a target
references a jtag newtap and a flash bank references a target).
</p>
<p>You can use the &ldquo;scan_chain&rdquo; command to verify and display the tap order.
</p>
<p>Also, some commands can&rsquo;t execute until after <code>init</code> has been
processed. Such commands include <code>nand probe</code> and everything
else that needs to write to controller registers, perhaps for setting
up DRAM and loading it with code.
</p>
<a name="faqtaporder"></a></li><li> <b>JTAG TAP Order</b> Do I have to declare the TAPS in some
particular order?

<p>Yes; whenever you have more than one, you must declare them in
the same order used by the hardware.
</p>
<p>Many newer devices have multiple JTAG TAPs. For example: ST
Microsystems STM32 chips have two TAPs, a &ldquo;boundary scan TAP&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Cortex-M3&rdquo; TAP. Example: The STM32 reference manual, Document ID:
RM0008, Section 26.5, Figure 259, page 651/681, the &ldquo;TDI&rdquo; pin is
connected to the boundary scan TAP, which then connects to the
Cortex-M3 TAP, which then connects to the TDO pin.
</p>
<p>Thus, the proper order for the STM32 chip is: (1) The Cortex-M3, then
(2) The boundary scan TAP. If your board includes an additional JTAG
chip in the scan chain (for example a Xilinx CPLD or FPGA) you could
place it before or after the STM32 chip in the chain. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li> OpenOCD_TDI(output) -&gt; STM32 TDI Pin (BS Input)
</li><li> STM32 BS TDO (output) -&gt; STM32 Cortex-M3 TDI (input)
</li><li> STM32 Cortex-M3 TDO (output) -&gt; SM32 TDO Pin
</li><li> STM32 TDO Pin (output) -&gt; Xilinx TDI Pin (input)
</li><li> Xilinx TDO Pin -&gt; OpenOCD TDO (input)
</li></ul>

<p>The &ldquo;jtag device&rdquo; commands would thus be in the order shown below. Note:
</p>
<ul>
<li> jtag newtap Xilinx tap -irlen ...
</li><li> jtag newtap stm32  cpu -irlen ...
</li><li> jtag newtap stm32  bs  -irlen ...
</li><li> # Create the debug target and say where it is
</li><li> target create stm32.cpu -chain-position stm32.cpu ...
</li></ul>


</li><li> <b>SYSCOMP</b> Sometimes my debugging session terminates with an error. When I look into the
log file, I can see these error messages: Error: arm7_9_common.c:561
arm7_9_execute_sys_speed(): timeout waiting for SYSCOMP

<p>TODO.
</p>
</li></ol>
